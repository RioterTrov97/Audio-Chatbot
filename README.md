# Audio-Chatbot

The Chatbot works on keyword-based model. 

It uses Google Speech Recognition to convert speech into text. 
The text is then processed to their respective outcomes.
Finally, to convert output text into speech, GTTS library (for online) and pytssx3 (for offline) is used.

Please feel free to use the code to learn or modify as per your use.
